## Week 8 :  Design Patterns and Principles  & Multithreading in java
---
---
###  Day  1 - Design Principles and Patterns
**Date:** 2-Feb-2026
* Studied basic concepts of design patterns and principles in java.
* Learnt the importance of principles.
* Studied common principles such as :
 >1. SOLID
 >2. YAGNI
 >3. KISS
* Also explored several patterns such as :
 >1. Creational design patterns.
 >2. Structural design patterns
 >3. Behavioral Design patterns.
* Studied implementation of principles and patterns.
* Practiced and pushed solutions on GitHub.
* View Code : [ Design patterns & principles ](https://github.com/Harsh-Raj-Singh25/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/java-design-pattern-practice/gcr-codebase/design_pattern_practice/src/com/design_patterns/libraryManagementSystem)

###  Day  2 - Design Patterns
* Studied about the GOF (gang of four) patterns.
* Learnt about many patterns such as :
 >1. Creational Patterns – deal with object creation (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Builder).
 >2. Structural Patterns – deal with object composition (e.g., Adapter, Composite, Decorator).
 >3. Behavioral Patterns – deal with communication/interaction (e.g., Observer, Strategy, Command).
* Practiced and pushed solutions on GitHub.

###  Day  3 - Multithreading 
**Date:** 4-Feb-2026
* Studied basic concepts of multithreading in java.
* Learnt the basic implementation and properties.
* Learnt how threads are created.
* Explored the thread life cycle.
* Studied about different types of threads such as user thread and daemon thread.
* Practiced and pushed solutions on GitHub.

###  Day  4 - Multithreading Implementation
**Date:** 5-Feb-2026
* Practiced problems with the help of multithreading.
* Learnt how to model real world problems in multithreading.
* Implemented classes and interfaces and defined relation between them.
* Explored problems such as:
 >1. Banking system.
 >2. Download manager.
 >3. Restaurant Order Processing System
 >4. Thread State Monitoring System
* solved problems and pushed solution to the github.
