# Java 8 programming features
 > This branch contains all my practice of java 8 features such as Lambda expressions, functional interfaces, Stream API, Collectors, Time & Date API, Optional class.
WEEK 7 : Java 8 features 
--- ---
### Day 1 - Lambda Expressions and functional Interfaces 
**Date:** 27-Jan-2026
* Studied about lambda expressions and their advantages.
* Learnt how lambda expressions help in making code efficient and shorter.
* Implemented different functional interfaces.
* Learnt how functional interfaces like Predicate, function, Supplier and consumer are used in Lambda expressions.
* Learnt about Method references.
* studied how method reference help define shorthand for lambda expressions.
* Explored different features of Java 8.
* Practiced problems.
* View Code :  [Lambda Expressions](https://github.com/Harsh-Raj-Singh25/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/java8-programming-practice/gcr-codebase/java8_practice/src/com/lambda_expressions)

### Day 2 - Stream API.
**Date:** 28-Jan-2026
* Studied about Stream API.
* Implemented different functions of stream API.
* Learnt the use of intermediate and terminal Operations.
* Studied about use of optional class & time and date API.
* Practiced real-World problems and pushed solution to the repository.
