10. "EduMentor – Personalized Learning Platform"
Story: EduMentor is an AI-based learning platform. You're tasked with implementing the module
to manage courses, quizzes, and learner progress.

Requirements:
● User base class: name, email, userId.
● Learner and Instructor inherit from User.
● ICertifiable interface with method generateCertificate().
● Quiz class: fields for questions, answers, and score.
● Use constructors to create quizzes with variable difficulty.
● Encapsulation for quiz answers (can’t be modified once set).
● Use operators to score the quiz and generate a percentage.
● Polymorphism: generateCertificate() works differently for short courses vs
full-time.
● Apply access modifiers: internal question banks must remain private.
