/* 
 *12. "PetPal – Virtual Pet Care App"
Story: You’re creating PetPal, an app that allows users to adopt and care for virtual pets like
dogs, cats, and birds.
Requirements:
● Pet base class: name, type, age.
● Derived classes: Dog, Cat, Bird (use inheritance).
● IInteractable interface with methods like feed(), play(), sleep().
● Encapsulation of hunger and mood levels.
● Use constructors to assign random default values or user-specified pets.
● Operators to increase/decrease energy, hunger based on interactions.
● Polymorphism: makeSound() behaves differently for each pet.
● Access modifiers ensure internal mood status is only modifiable through methods.
