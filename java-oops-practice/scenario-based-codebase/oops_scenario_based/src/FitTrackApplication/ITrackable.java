/*11. "FitTrack – Your Personal Fitness Tracker"
Story: You’ve been hired to develop FitTrack, a fitness tracking app that monitors users'
workouts, calories, and daily progress.
Requirements:
● UserProfile class with fields like name, age, weight, goal.
● Workout class to track type, duration, caloriesBurned.
● Constructors to allow user creation with default or custom goals.
● ITrackable interface with startWorkout() and stopWorkout() methods.
● Use encapsulation to protect private health data (e.g., weight).
● Operators to compute calorie targets and progress (dailyTarget -
caloriesBurned).
● Inheritance: CardioWorkout, StrengthWorkout extend Workout.
● Polymorphism: calculateCalories() differs by workout type.
● Access modifiers to restrict internal workout logs from being exposed directly.*/


public interface ITrackable {
	void startWorkout();
	void stopWorkout();
}
